# Answers to technical questions



## 1.How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add?
* I spent around 3 hrs of time on the technical test. Being the first time on this Just_EAt Website I have to understand the task requirements and Functionality of the Website before writing any code. Much of my time was eaten away by understanding the nature of the website and behavior.

* If I had more time to spend on this, then there are endless possibilities that can I come up with:
  1. Write more functional test cases, for example, Login, Registration, Payment card details entering.
  2.  Create a Robust Framework, Maybe include data-driven testing using excel or SQL or implement a page object model or even we could implement the BDD Cucumber framework.
   3. Design Test Suites or Test cases in such a way they can be used multiple times anywhere we need them.More robust reusable java methods for testing


## 2.What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
The technological improvements in the software testing industry push testers and QA to enhance their skills, expertise, and quality frequently. It is a special challenge not only for software testers but also for the complete team to discuss the technological updates and improvements. It’s hard to guess, but recently heard about these top 5 emerging software testing trends:
1. Codeless Test Automation:
 Codeless test automation tools help the Software testers who do not know how to code. It helps them to automate test cases without in-depth knowledge of coding or programming knowledge. Even Business users can also automate the test case with the help of these tools. It helps to deliver faster results and decreases the time consumed to understand the code.
2. Artificial Intelligence:
To ensure the best accuracy and precision for a better Digital Transformation, the world is turning towards Artificial Intelligence. This signifies that instead of manual testing and human interference, we are moving towards a situation where machines will be gradually assuming control
3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA):
RPA is the latest technology that can re-invent the business process management aspect.
4. Blend of Agile and DevOps:
The demand to adopt industry changes and faster delivery to the market is driving organizations to digital transformation. And, this results in an enhanced adoption of organizational practices and methodologies like DevOps and Agile. Even for the most complicated systems, this will drive to faster deployments and assuring high-quality products that are delivered in a cost-effective manner.
5. Adoption in IoT Testing:
Nowadays, most of the business enterprises are embracing the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT apps and devices are tested for performance, security, and usability. Most of the customers depend on IoT testing before the acquisition of their products. All the IoT devices expect Internet connectivity, therefore, exposed to security flaws and risks. 

## 3.How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

I’ve heard that “the definition of a legacy application is one that does not have any automated tests.” If My Assumption is True, then yes, I did implement test automation for the legacy application. By nature, software features are first tested manually, most of the time followed by scripted test cases, and then the QA team starts thinking of ways to automate the testing.  

Then how do we approach automating the testing legacy systems? 
There is no single answer to this question.  I believe what works best is to take the problem back to the team and start the discussion.

The solution varies based on many factors such as the application under test, the skills of the team, and the value the team wants to gain from automated testing.  There are several factors teams need to take into account when starting the endeavor of automated testing. 

The best-automated test solutions involve tests at the unit, integration, and user levels.  When starting out, ask when will the tests be executed, who will execute them, how frequently, and how much execution time will be tolerated before the team refactors the tests to improve performance?  These are important things the team should agree upon from the beginning (not to say the decisions cannot be altered after learning more).

## 4.How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

My top 2 Suggestions would be:
1.	Enhance Website Navigation/ Product Search: We can improve Customer Experience at Just Eat Website by making it a Responsive Web design. That means if a user switches between viewing our website on a Mobile device to viewing on a Desktop, the website should automatically adapt to cater to the different resolutions.
2.	Minimize the Hassle in the Checkout Process: Keep it simple – this is nothing new therefore it is a must that we keep business transactions simplified. People in general appreciate uncomplicated online transactions. 
•	While customers shop around, shopping carts must be clearly and easily accessible on every page. 
•	We should also include any special offers that will  Customer to save some money. 
•	Make an inventory and recommended products visible. 

## 5.Please describe yourself using JSON.

Testing and validating JSON APIs is an important aspect of running a quality web service but managing checks for large and diverse response bodies can be difficult. Using JSON Schema to construct a model for our API response makes it easier to validate whether our API is returning the right data or not. 

Most of the System interfaces make use of Web Service or APIs. It doesn’t always have a UI but it does accept input and provide output. Being one of the most widely used data transfer formats, JSON can be used for interface data transfer.

A tester needs to have basic JSON structure knowledge to create test data (in the form of JSON) and to read output data from the system. A tester should also be well-versed with the mapping between JSON keys and database table-column.
